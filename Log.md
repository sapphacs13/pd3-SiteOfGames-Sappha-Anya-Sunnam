6/2 - Sunnam - Created the board (6 x 7) in Processing for Connect Four
6/3 - Sappha - Reformatted board and added colors
6/3 - Sunnam - Added booleans and fixed minor problems in drawing
6/3-4 - Anya - Resized things, added new row, created way to logically add pieces to the board
6/6 - Sappha - Reformatted the if statements to condense code
6/6 - Anya - Added statements to prevent circles from going off the board
6/9 - Sappha - Added reset button, but it doesn't quite reset, then I made it work (help from Sunnam)
6/9 - Anya - Made alternation of the color of pieces work properlly, prompts the user to choose a column with free slots (help from Sunnam)
6/9 - Anya - Created a way to keep track of color and location of pieces
6/9 - Sappha - Added a place() method for both red and black, and condensed mouseClicked() but it fails to work when a column is filled by the user. Have not looked over Anya's new code yet. Most likely must merge ideas.
6/9 - Sunnam - tried to fix the weird bugs that had resulted from the merge of Sappha and Anya's codes
6/10 - Sunnam - Made it run by using the history to unbreak the code.
6/10 - Sappha/Anya/Sunnam - Together, we have (hopefully) fixed all merge conflicts and the code (I think) compiles correctly
6/10 - Sunnam - Fixed reset button, works completely now. Also made it so that if a column is full, it will not count an extra black/red piece on the board.
6/10 - Anya/Sappha - Corrected the place that pieces were added to. Pieces are now aded to the column that is clicked on.
6/10 = Anya - attempted to fix the deletion of the text.
