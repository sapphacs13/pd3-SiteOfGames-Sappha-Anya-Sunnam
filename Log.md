Date - Name - What you did

*Note: We worked on this project everyday in class, but always ended up using Sappha and Anya's computers. This is the reason for the uneven amount of commits for Sunnam.

6/2 - Sunnam - Created the board (6 x 7) in Processing for Connect Four
6/3 - Sappha - Reformatted board and added colors
6/3 - Sunnam - Added booleans and fixed minor problems in drawing
6/3-4 - Anya - Resized things, added new row, created way to logically add pieces to the board
6/6 - Sappha - Reformatted the if statements to condense code
6/6 - Anya - Added statements to prevent circles from going off the board
6/9 - Sappha - Added reset button, but it doesn't quite reset, then I made it work (help from Sunnam)
6/9 - Anya - Made alternation of the color of pieces work properlly, prompts the user to choose a column with free slots (help from Sunnam)
6/9 - Anya - Created a way to keep track of color and location of pieces
6/9 - Sappha - Added a place() method for both red and black, and condensed mouseClicked() but it fails to work when a column is filled by the user. Have not looked over Anya's new code yet. Most likely must merge ideas.
6/9 - Sunnam - tried to fix the weird bugs that had resulted from the merge of Sappha and Anya's codes
6/10 - Sunnam - Made it run by using the history to unbreak the code.
6/10 - Sappha/Anya/Sunnam - Together, we have (hopefully) fixed all merge conflicts and the code (I think) compiles correctly
6/10 - Sunnam - Fixed reset button, works completely now. Also made it so that if a column is full, it will not count an extra black/red piece on the board.
6/10 - Anya/Sappha - Corrected the place that pieces were added to. Pieces are now aded to the column that is clicked on.
6/10 - Anya - attempted to fix the deletion of the text.
6/11 - Sappha - completed winV(), but it only prints win and does not stop the game. Also, if you click reset, computerTurn() is run.
6/11 - Sappha - So winH is done, but it doesn't work and I don't know why. The mouseClicked reset thing I broke earlier is fixed. Also, we still need a method to end the game. I hope someone reads these things.
6/12 - Anya - I created the delay method and placed it in certain places. The win methods mess the game up a bit, but we'll figure that out. Go Team SAS!
6/12 - Sunnam - Had trouble running it a lot (kept crashing). Still testing and figuring out how to fix winV() and winH()
6/12 - Sappha/Sunnam - fixed winV(), working on winH(), Anya's fixing delay()
6/13 - Anya - The delay method does not cause Processing to shut down any more!!!!!!!!! It doesn't work in the context that I want it to work in though.
6/15 - Anya - Added 20Qs with a Node class.
6/15 - Sappha - Fixed winH()
6/16 - Anya - Added Brick Breaker.
6/16 - Sunnam - Added 20Q's
